# Blood Bank Management System
   This is an android based Blood Bank Management System  which will provide a means of communication
between the blood seekers, blood donors & blood banks in case of any emergency and will also
maintain the record of the blood donors and recipients. 

 This application can be very handy when the hospital authorities or a person is in urgent
need for blood. A person can post a request for the particular blood group using this application and
it will be visible to all the application users. So, based on this our main aim was to develop an
android application which will include all the relevant features that will help the users in such a way
that they can locate blood donors and blood banks in their locality with ease. Our app’s user
interface is developed in such a way that it’s attractive, easy to understand and self-explanatory.
Also, users can access our application in offline mode as well.
